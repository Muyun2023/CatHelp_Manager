                <p><b>Cat History</b> 1. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. 2. Cats evolved from a solitary wild lifestyle, making them less attuned to social cues. Historians have proposed that as people began to grow crops and use grain stores, this attracted mice and rats, and with the abundance of prey came the wild cats. 3. Cats began their unique relationship with humans 10,000 to 12,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, the geographic region where some of the earliest developments in human civilization occurred (encompassing modern day parts of West Asia).</p>

                <p><b>Cat Fun Facts</b> 1. Cats do not have a sweet tooth, unlike humans and dogs! Cats are not the only animals that purr. Calico and tortoiseshell cats are almost always female. Anytime there is a male calico, it has an XXY gene mutation. 2. Cats have nearly twice the amount of neurons in their cerebral cortex as dogs. Cats have the largest eyes relative to their head size of any mammal. Cats make very little noise when they walk around. The thick, soft pads on their paws allow them to sneak up on their prey — or you! 3. From a young age a cat's mother would not only lick them as a way of grooming them, but also to show affection. Cats then replicate this behaviour with you as a way of showing their own affection – it simply comes naturally. This licking behaviour is not just exclusive between pet and owner.</p>
